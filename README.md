# Super-Quantum-Laser-Calculator
This calc (calculator) is the first calculator ever to use dark matter, advanced quantum computing and laser technology. This makes it the world's fastest and most accurate calculator. 
Development started in 1922 as a secret project of Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein. It was recently found and continued by the world's greatest programmer (me). 
With this advanced quantum calculator you can calculate the sum of up to two numbers.
I hope you enjoy solving your mathematical problems.
