# Super-Quantum-Laser-Calculator
This calc (calculator) is the first calculator ever to use dark matter and advanced quantum physics. This makes it the world's fastest and most accurate calculator. You can even add two numbers together.
Development started in 1922 as a secret project of Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein. It was recently found and continued by the world's greatest programmer (me). 
I hope you enjoy solving your mathematical problems.
